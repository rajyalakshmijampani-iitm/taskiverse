# README.md

## Dataset Purpose
The dataset encompasses various indicators of well-being and socio-economic status across different countries from the year 2005 to 2023. Major components include happiness levels (Life Ladder), economic prosperity measured by GDP per capita, social support quality, health metrics like life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption. This dataset is crucial for understanding how these factors interact and influence overall happiness and quality of life from a global perspective.

## Key Findings
1. **Life Ladder and Economic Indicators**: The average Life Ladder score across countries is approximately 5.48, with a standard deviation of 1.13, indicating a range of happiness levels. Higher GDP per capita correlates with increased happiness, further supported by analyses and visualizations.

2. **Social Support and Well-being**: The average social support score is around 0.81. Higher social support appears linked to elevated happiness levels, showcasing the importance of communities.

3. **Health Metrics**: The life expectancy at birth averages around 63.4 years, reflecting the health standards in various countries that have been associated with happiness levels.

4. **Freedom and Happiness**: The dataset demonstrates that freedom to make life choices, which averages 0.75, contributes positively to overall happiness levels, suggesting societies that prioritize individual freedoms tend to have happier populations.

5. **Generosity and Perceptions of Corruption**: Notably low average generosity scores contrast with relatively high perceptions of corruption at 0.74, indicating potential areas for social improvement.

## Insights
- The correlation between economic growth (Log GDP per capita) and happiness (Life Ladder score) underscores the significant role of income and wealth in enhancing life satisfaction among citizens.
- A distribution analysis of social support shows that it is a vital contributor to happiness, particularly in lower-income nations where safety nets may be lacking.
- Health outcomes such as life expectancy directly impact how societies view and experience happiness over time.
